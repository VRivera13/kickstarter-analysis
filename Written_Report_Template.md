# How Launch Dates and Funding Goals affect Campaign Outcomes

## Overview of Project
Review outcomes of different campaigns based on launch dates and funding goals.
### Purpose
Provide Louise with data that outlines how the launch dates and funding goals affect the whether campaign will be successful.
## Analysis and Challenges
Using the information from the Kickstarter file, I was able to isolate the sub-category "plays" along with their launch dates to determine the best months of the year to have a successful campaign.  
With mirroring using the data from the Kickstarter file, was able to find correlation between successful and failed attempts of meeting funding goals.   Difficulties that could be encountered would be if the data selected
was not in scope with what is being reviewed.    You would not want to pull data for pledged amount when looking to see if established goal amount has been met.  Without the goal amount, you would not be able to determine
if the set goal amount was indeed met.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Reviewing the launch date data, the months with the most successful campains were in May, June, and July.    During these early summer months, people tend to have more free time, take more vacation days, to be able to enjoy events.  
Depending where located, could also be months where the weather is more enjoyable and allows for more outdoor activity.
December seems to one month where the successful and failed rate cross paths.  Possibilites could be due to the weather depending on location as well as being a heavy holiday month.    
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The less the goal amount the more successful a campaign is at meeting their funding goal.    The higher the funding goal, the most likely it is for a campaign to fail.   Also seems that once a paritcular favored campaign will get more 
funding at a particular time which will cause other campaigns to fail.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
-The less the goal amount the more successful a campaign is at meeting their funding goal.    The higher the funding goal, the most likely it is for a campaign to fail.   Also seems that once a paritcular favored campaign will get more 
funding at a particular time which will cause other campaigns to fail.
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
Limitations of the dataset is that the campaigns occur during different years.   Each year could have had a different event occurr which would skew the outcomes.   Examples:  Weather, earthquake, recession, war, etc. 
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
I would say a stacked bar graph could also be used to represent the data.
